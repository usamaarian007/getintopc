Because when thousands of users start downloading these large files, we have to add more servers to handle the bandwidth. Therefore we have to pay huge rent on a monthly basis to keep these servers up and running.",
       p3: " Secondly, we hate to give any third party free file sharing links because they can be dead sooner or later. Although they are free, we donâ€™t use them. Because after six months or so, all free links can be dead. Same is the case with torrents which can become dead eventually and there are no seeders.",
       p4: "That is why we decided to take the hit on our own and rented servers for you. So that you can download unlimited files with a single direct link. But with the growing file sizes, this is getting hard for us, because we have to rent more and more servers to handle the bandwidth. I would also like to add that we spend huge time testing software before uploading. So that you may not face any problems.",
